				<h1>Why Your <span class="text-primary">Attitude</span> Is Everything</h1>
				<p>
					One of the most important steps you can take toward achieving your
					<span class="text-primary">Greatest Potential</span> in life is to learn to
					monitor your attitude and its impact on your work performance, relationships and
					everyone around you.

			<div class="statergies-box">
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="far fa-comment-dots"></i> Self-Coaching Through Affirmations</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Affirmations repeated several times each day, every day, serve to reprogram your
					subconscious with positive thinking. An affirmation is made up of words charged
					with power, conviction and faith. You send a positive response to your
					subconscious, which accepts whatever you tell it. When done properly, this
					triggers positive feelings that, in turn, drive action.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-fire"></i> Self-Motivation Through Discovering Your Motives</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Discover what motivates you—what incites you to take action to change your life.
					Basic motives include love, self-preservation, anger, financial gain and fear.
					Self-motivation requires enthusiasm, a positive outlook, a positive physiology
					(walk faster, smile, sit up), and a belief in yourself and your God-given
					potential.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-battery-full"></i> The Power of Visualization</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Studies of the psychology of peak performance have found that most great
					athletes, surgeons, engineers and artists use affirmations and visualizations
					either consciously or subconsciously to enhance and focus their skills. Nelson
					Mandela has written extensively on how visualization helped him maintain a
					positive attitude while being imprisoned for 27 years. “I thought continually of
					the day when I would walk free. I fantasized about what I would like to do,” he
					wrote in his autobiography. Visualization works well to improve attitude.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-comment-dots"></i> Attitude Talk for Positive Internal Dialogue</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Attitude talk is a way to override your past negative programming by erasing or
					replacing it with a conscious, positive internal voice that helps you face new
					directions. Your internal conversation—that little voice you listen to all day
					long—acts like a seed in that it programs your brain and affects your behavior.
					Take a closer look at what you are saying to yourself.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-fire-alt"></i> The Power of Words—WOW</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Once released to the universe, our words cannot be taken back. Learn the concept
					of WOW—watch our words. What we speak reflects what is already in our hearts
					based upon all the things we have come to believe about ourselves. If we find
					ourselves speaking judgmental and disparaging things about our circumstances or
					those around us, we know the condition of our hearts needs to change. You can
					create a direct path to success by what you say.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-burn"></i> The Power in a Positive Greeting</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					When people ask me how I am doing, I say, “Super-fantastic.” Most people enjoy
					working and living with others who try to live life for what it is—a beautiful
					gift.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fab fa-gripfire"></i> Enthusiasm: Vital Tool for Staying Motivated</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Enthusiasm is to attitude what breathing is to life. Enthusiasm enables you to
					apply your gifts more effectively. It’s the burning desire that communicates
					commitment, determination and spirit. Enthusiasm means putting yourself in
					motion. It’s an internal spirit that speaks through your actions from your
					commitment and your belief in what you are doing. It is one of the most
					empowering and attractive characteristics you can have.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-wifi"></i> Connecting to Your Spiritual Empowerment</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					The ultimate level of human need extends into the spiritual realm. Just as we
					feed our bodies in response to our primary need to survive physically, we need
					to feed our spirit because we are spiritual beings. Many people find powerful
					and positive motivation in their faith. I happen to be one of them.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="far fa-laugh"></i> Lighten Up Your Life with Humor</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					Humor is a powerful motivator. The more humor and laughter in your life, the
					less stress you’ll have, which means more positive energy to help you put your
					attitude into action. There are also health benefits to lightening up.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statergy">
				<h3 class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-running"></i> Exercising Will Help Keep You Motivated</h3 class="text-primary">
				<p>
					One of the best ways to move to a more positive and motivated frame of mind is
					to exercise. A regular exercise routine can provide relatively quick positive
					feedback in the form of weight loss, muscle development and a sense of doing
					something positive for yourself.
